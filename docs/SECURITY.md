# NanoIDP Security Guide

## Overview

NanoIDP is a **development and testing tool** designed for local development environments, integration testing, and CI/CD pipelines.

**WARNING: Do NOT use NanoIDP in production environments.**

By design, NanoIDP prioritizes developer convenience over security hardening. It is intended to help developers test OAuth2/OIDC and SAML integrations without the complexity of production identity providers.

---

## Network Binding

NanoIDP binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only) by default, so out of the box it is reachable only from the local machine.

This matters because the management API (`/api/*`) is **unauthenticated by design** (see [MCP Server Security](#mcp-server-security) for the equivalent concern on the MCP side). Those endpoints can mint a validly signed access token for any user, including `admin`, rotate the signing keys, and clear the audit log. Loopback binding keeps that surface off the network. If you need it reachable by more than one host, also consider [`management_secret`](#management-secret), which requires a shared secret for these mutating calls specifically (reads stay open either way).

### Exposing on a network

If you deliberately need NanoIDP reachable from other hosts or containers, set the host explicitly:

```bash
# CLI flag
python -m nanoidp --host 0.0.0.0

# or in settings.yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
```

The bundled Docker image already sets `--host 0.0.0.0`, because inside a container the isolation boundary is the container network rather than the host loopback. When you bind to all interfaces, NanoIDP logs a startup warning, since the unauthenticated management API then becomes reachable by any host that can route to the port. Only do this on a trusted, isolated network.

---

## Config UI Login Gate

`/login` and `/logout` exist on the web UI, but by default they don't gate
anything - every dashboard page (users, clients, settings, keys, claims,
audit log, token tester) is reachable without a session, same as the rest of
the unauthenticated management surface described above. `require_ui_login`
makes `/login` real:

```yaml
session:
  require_ui_login: true   # default: false
```

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `false` (default) | The config web UI is unauthenticated, like today |
| `true` | Every web UI page except `/login` itself redirects to `/login` until a session exists |

`/management/unlock` (the [`management_secret`](#management-secret) unlock
form) is exempt from this redirect too, whether or not a login session
exists yet - `management_secret` is an independent axis (see below), and
gating it on a login session it doesn't depend on would make the unlock form
`/login` renders whenever `management_secret` is configured silently do
nothing.

**What it does not protect**: the separate management API (`/api/*`) stays
unauthenticated regardless of this setting - it's a distinct Flask blueprint
that a UI-only login gate structurally cannot reach. If you enable
`require_ui_login` because the dashboard is reachable by more than just you,
also keep `/api/*` off the network (see [Network Binding](#network-binding)
above), set [`management_secret`](#management-secret) to gate its mutations,
or put it behind your own auth layer; this setting does nothing for it.

**Relationship to `management_secret`**: these are independent axes.
`require_ui_login` is the UI's session front door - it controls who can view
the dashboard at all. `management_secret` (below) is the write guard - it
controls who can change anything, on all three management surfaces, whether
or not `require_ui_login` is on. With both off, nothing is enforced, same as
today.

**Persona mode interaction**: logging in via `/login` or via the SAML SSO
inline login at `/saml/sso` both satisfy this gate - they authenticate
through the same `interactive_authenticate()` call and set the same session.
If [Persona Login Mode](#persona-login-mode) is also enabled
(`login.mode: persona`), that call is identity selection only, with no
credential check. In that combination, `require_ui_login` confirms a user
was picked from a list, not that anyone was verified - it is not protection
against anyone who can reach the port.

**YAML-only**: like `secret_key` and `security_profile`, this is not exposed
on the Settings page or the MCP `update_settings` tool. It's a fixed operator
decision about the trust boundary of the surface itself, not something meant
to be flipped from inside the surface it protects.

**Session trust caveat**: this gate's protection depends entirely on
`secret_key` being a real, private value - see
[Session Cookie Trust](#session-cookie-trust-secret_key) below.

---

## Session Cookie Trust (`secret_key`)

Both `require_ui_login` (above) and `management_secret`'s web UI leg (below)
work by reading something out of the Flask session - a client-side cookie
Flask *signs* but does not encrypt, using `secret_key`. Anyone who knows
`secret_key` can construct arbitrary session content and have Flask accept it
as genuine, including `session['user']` (what `require_ui_login` checks).

```yaml
session:
  secret_key: "a real, private value"   # default: a public, well-known string
```

`secret_key` ships with a public default
(`dev-secret-key-change-in-production`, identical in every install unless
changed) so NanoIDP works out of the box. That's harmless as long as nothing
security-relevant depends on the session; `require_ui_login` and
`management_secret` both now do. NanoIDP logs a startup warning when
`secret_key` is left at its default while either is configured.

The two gates are not equally exposed by this. `require_ui_login`'s
`session['user']` is a bare value with no independent verification - with a
default `secret_key`, anyone who can reach the port can forge it and skip the
login gate entirely. `management_secret`'s session flag
(`session['management_verified']`) is additionally bound to
`management_secret` itself via an HMAC (see
[Management Secret](#management-secret)), not stored as a bare boolean, so
knowing only the default `secret_key` is not enough to forge it - the forger
would also need to know `management_secret`, the thing being protected.
Set a real `secret_key` before relying on either gate beyond a single
trusted machine.

The session cookie is also set with `SameSite=Lax`. Once `management_secret`
is unlocked, the session authorizes `/api/*` mutations
(`management_secret_required_for_api` accepts an already-unlocked session,
[above](#management-secret)) in addition to `ui_bp`'s own forms - so the
cross-site form-POST surface that already existed for the dashboard now
covers the management API too, on any browser that doesn't default new
cookies to `Lax` on its own. `SameSite=Lax` closes that: the cookie isn't
sent on a cross-site POST, only on top-level navigation.

---

## Management Secret

`management_secret` is one shared secret that gates **mutations** across all
three management surfaces - the MCP server, `/api/*`, and the config web UI -
instead of each surface growing its own opt-in mechanism independently. It
does not gate reads: listing users, viewing settings, decoding tokens, and
the dashboard itself stay reachable exactly as they are today. Off by
default - unset, nothing is enforced, identical to before this setting
existed.

```yaml
session:
  management_secret: "your-secret-here"   # default: unset
```

Must be printable ASCII - Werkzeug decodes request headers as latin-1, so a
non-ASCII secret could never be matched via the `X-Management-Secret` header
even though the form and MCP's JSON argument would see it correctly;
rejected at startup with a clear error rather than shipping a secret that
silently only half-works.

Also loadable from the `NANOIDP_MANAGEMENT_SECRET` environment variable.
`NANOIDP_MCP_ADMIN_SECRET` - this setting's MCP-only predecessor - keeps
working as an alias, so existing MCP-only setups aren't broken by upgrading.
Precedence: an explicit `management_secret` key in settings.yaml's `session:`
block wins over both env vars *even when its value is empty or `null`* -
presence in YAML is read as the operator deliberately stating "off", distinct
from the key being absent. Only when the key is absent entirely do the env
vars apply, `NANOIDP_MANAGEMENT_SECRET` before the legacy
`NANOIDP_MCP_ADMIN_SECRET`. Env vars are read once, when configuration loads (startup, or an explicit
`reload_config`) - not on every request, so changing one in the environment
has no effect until then.

Each surface proves knowledge of the secret differently, matching how that
surface already talks to NanoIDP:

| Surface | How the secret is supplied |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| MCP server | The existing `admin_secret` tool argument on any [mutating tool](#mutating-tools) - see [Admin Secret Protection](#admin-secret-protection) |
| `/api/*` | An `X-Management-Secret` request header on any `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` |
| Web UI (`ui_bp`) | A one-time "Unlock management actions" form on `/login`; once submitted correctly, the session is trusted for the rest of its lifetime - the same trust model `require_ui_login` already uses for `session['user']`, so you aren't re-prompted on every click |

A UI mutation attempted before the secret has been unlocked for that session
redirects to `/login` with a prompt to unlock, rather than silently failing;
retry the action after unlocking. The web UI's own dashboard pages
(users, token tester, audit log) call `/api/*` from client-side JavaScript
using the browser's session cookie, not the header - an already-unlocked
session satisfies `/api/*`'s gate too, so those buttons keep working after
one unlock; a non-browser client still needs the header.

What's actually stored in `session['management_verified']` is an HMAC of
`management_secret` itself (keyed by `secret_key`), not a bare boolean - see
[Session Cookie Trust](#session-cookie-trust-secret_key) for why that
distinction matters.

**Relationship to `require_ui_login`**: independent axes - see
[Config UI Login Gate](#config-ui-login-gate) above.
`require_ui_login` is the session front door (who can view the dashboard);
`management_secret` is the write guard (who can change anything). Either,
both, or neither can be enabled.

**YAML-only**: like `secret_key`, `require_ui_login`, and `security_profile`,
this is not exposed on the Settings page or the MCP `update_settings` tool -
a secret editable through the surface it protects isn't a secret.

---

## Security Profiles

NanoIDP supports three security profiles to balance convenience with basic security controls:

| Profile | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dev` (default) | Maximum convenience for development: plaintext passwords, permissive CORS, no rate limiting |
| `stricter-dev` | Semi-hardened runtime: bcrypt passwords, restricted CORS, rate limiting, debug mode blocked |
| `oauth21` | Draft OAuth 2.1 protocol strictness (#68): PKCE required (S256 only), refresh token rotation on, password grant removed, registered redirect URIs mandatory at `/authorize` |

`stricter-dev` hardens the *runtime*; `oauth21` hardens the *protocol*. They are deliberately orthogonal. The discovery document always reflects the active profile: under `oauth21`, `password` disappears from `grant_types_supported` and `code_challenge_methods_supported` is `["S256"]`.

### Usage

```bash
# Run with default dev profile
python -m nanoidp

# Run with stricter-dev profile
python -m nanoidp --profile stricter-dev

# Run with draft OAuth 2.1 protocol strictness
python -m nanoidp --profile oauth21
```

`--profile` is a per-run override: when given (any of the three values,
including an explicit `dev`) it wins over `security_profile` in
`settings.yaml`, is never written back to the file, and is re-applied after
every configuration reload, including the reload that follows each web UI or
MCP save. The `stricter-dev` runtime hardening (`require_pkce`,
`password_hashing`, `rate_limit_enabled`, debug off) is derived from the
effective profile on every reload the same way, whether the profile came from
the flag or from YAML. `GET /api/config` reports the effective profile,
whether it came from an override, and the derived values (#172).

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | `dev` | `stricter-dev` | `oauth21` |
|---------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Password storage | Plaintext | bcrypt hash | Plaintext |
| CORS | `*` (all origins) | localhost only | `*` (all origins) |
| Rate limiting | None | 10 req/min on `/token` | None |
| Debug mode | Allowed | Blocked | Allowed |
| PKCE | Optional | Required, S256 only | Required, S256 only |
| Refresh token rotation | Setting (`off`) | Setting (`off`) | Forced on |
| `password` grant | Enabled | Enabled | Removed (and not advertised) |
| Redirect URIs at `/authorize` | Any valid URI, or exact match if registered | Same as `dev` | Registration mandatory, exact match |

### Invalid bcrypt hash fallback

When `password_hashing` is on, a stored `users.yaml` password that isn't a
valid bcrypt hash is *not* rejected by default - `authenticate()` catches the
format error and falls back to a plain string comparison, only logging a
warning. This exists so turning on `stricter-dev`/`password_hashing` doesn't
immediately lock out every user until each one is manually re-hashed.

To close that gap, opt in to:

```yaml
session:
  enforce_password_check: true   # default: false
```

With this on, a user whose `users.yaml` password isn't already a bcrypt hash
simply can't log in - no plaintext fallback, no warning-and-continue. Has no
effect when `password_hashing` is off (that path is intentionally plaintext,
dev mode). Like `secret_key` and `require_ui_login`, this is YAML-only - not
on the Settings page or the MCP `update_settings` tool.

---

## Persona Login Mode

Interactive logins can optionally skip password prompts entirely and let you sign in by picking a configured user from a list - handy for local testing when you just want to switch between users quickly, without looking up passwords.

Opt-in and off by default:

```yaml
login:
  mode: persona   # default: password
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `password` (default) | Interactive logins require the configured password |
| `persona` | Interactive logins list the configured users; sign in by selecting one, no password prompt |

**Where it applies**: every interactive login surface - the nanoidp dashboard's `/login`, OIDC's `/authorize`, SAML's `/saml/sso`, and the device authorization flow's `/device` verification page.

**Where it doesn't apply**: the OAuth2 `password` grant (`grant_type=password` at `/token`) is unaffected either way - it's a machine-to-machine credential exchange, not an interactive login. A user with no `password` configured (see below) simply can never authenticate through it, in either mode.

**Password-less users**: `password` is optional on a user in `users.yaml`. A user without one can only sign in via persona mode - they're rejected by password-mode login and the OAuth password grant alike.

```yaml
users:
  admin:
    password: "admin"          # still works with either login mode
  alice:
    email: "alice@example.org" # no password: persona-mode only
    description: "Standard internal user" # optional, max 200 chars
```

**Descriptions in the picker**: an optional `description` per user is shown
next to their name in the picker on every surface above - e.g. "Finance
approver persona", "Read-only auditor". It's a display-only note, capped at
200 characters and plain text only: never a claim, never a SAML attribute,
never part of a token, and never treated as a custom attribute.

**SAML detail**: a persona login can't claim `AuthnContextClassRef: PasswordProtectedTransport`, since no password was used - NanoIDP emits `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:unspecified` instead for sessions authenticated this way.

**Orthogonal to security profiles**: `login.mode` and `security_profile` are independent settings. `security_profile` governs OAuth/SAML protocol strictness; `login.mode` only changes how the interactive login UI authenticates the resource owner. Persona mode works the same under any profile.

Like the rest of NanoIDP, this is a local development/testing convenience - it is never intended as an authentication mode for a deployed environment.

### Auto-Login (automated testing)

A further opt-in on top of persona mode, for driving a real OIDC client library in automated integration tests - no username/password entry, no HTTP calls of your own into nanoidp's login form:

```yaml
login:
  mode: persona
  auto_login: true   # default: false; has no effect unless mode is persona
```

With both set, an OIDC `/authorize` request whose `login_hint` is exactly `persona-auto-login:USERNAME` authenticates that user directly and issues the authorization code - no picker, no HTML page in the way. Any other `login_hint` is an ordinary hint outside this feature and is passed through unchanged; with the flag off, a prefixed hint is inert too, so the picker still shows exactly as before.

An unknown username in the hint reports through the same channel every other post-`redirect_uri` `/authorize` error uses: a redirect to the client with `error=invalid_request` and `state` preserved, never a bare `400` - a test asserting on a failed authorization sees the failure the same way any other rejected request does.

First implementation surface is OIDC `/authorize` only; the device flow and SAML have no defined transport for the hint today. It is only ever read from a `GET` request's own query string - never from the POST body of a login form submission, which the login page itself never sends it on anyway (#325).

Auto-login removes the one human click persona mode still required, so for any client used with it, register its `redirect_uris` rather than relying on the permissive dev default that accepts any `redirect_uri` - otherwise a plain GET link mints a code for any configured persona to anywhere.

## Key Management

NanoIDP uses RSA keys for JWT signing. Keys can be auto-generated, imported from external files, or rotated dynamically.

### Auto-generated Keys

By default, NanoIDP generates RSA keys on first startup and stores them in the `keys/` directory:

```
config/
└── keys/
    ├── private.pem      # RSA private key (signing)
    ├── public.pem       # RSA public key (verification)
    └── kid.txt          # Key ID
```

### External Keys

You can use your own RSA keys instead of auto-generated ones:

```yaml
# settings.yaml
jwt:
  external_keys:
    private_key: /path/to/private.pem
    public_key: /path/to/public.pem
    kid: "my-custom-key-id"
```

Requirements:
- Private key: PEM format, PKCS8 encoding
- Public key: PEM format, SubjectPublicKeyInfo encoding
- Key ID (optional): If not provided, one is generated from the key fingerprint

### Key Rotation

NanoIDP supports key rotation with multiple keys in JWKS for seamless token validation during rotation periods.

#### API Endpoints

```bash
# Rotate keys (generates new key, preserves old for validation)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/keys/rotate

# Get key information
curl http://localhost:8000/api/keys/info
```

#### How It Works

1. **Rotation**: New key pair generated, old key moved to "previous" list
2. **JWKS**: Returns both active and previous keys (configurable via `max_previous_keys`, default 2)
3. **Signing**: New tokens signed with the active key
4. **Validation**: Tokens signed with previous keys remain valid until those keys are rotated out

#### Configuration

```yaml
# settings.yaml
jwt:
  max_previous_keys: 2  # Number of previous keys to keep in JWKS
```

---

## Hooks and Plugins

`hooks:` (shell commands run before a configuration load, after a
configuration save and after an audit event) and `plugins:` (Python
packages loaded from the `nanoidp.plugins` entry-point group) extend
nanoidp from outside the core; see the
[Extending nanoidp](https://cdelmonte-zg.github.io/nanoidp/guides/extending.html)
guide. Two facts matter here:

- A Python plugin runs with the process's privileges. Installing one is a
  trust decision like any other dependency.
- A shell hook runs whatever the YAML says, through the shell, with
  nanoidp's environment. `settings.yaml` and `bootstrap.yaml` are
  operator-owned by definition, the same trust boundary as `secret_key`
  and `management_secret`, which is why hooks and plugins are YAML-only:
  the web UI and the MCP `update_settings` tool report them and cannot
  change them. A configuration surface that could set a command would be a
  remote-execution primitive.

Hooks never run on the protocol path and cannot fail a request: an
`on_audit_event` failure is counted and logged, never propagated.

## MCP Server Security

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Security Warning

The MCP server exposes powerful administrative tools and should ONLY be used:
- Locally on developer machines
- In isolated development environments
- **Never** exposed to network access

### Mutating Tools

The following MCP tools modify configuration and require extra caution:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_user` | Create a new user |
| `create_persona_user` | Create a password-less user (persona login mode) |
| `update_user` | Modify user attributes |
| `delete_user` | Remove a user |
| `create_client` | Create OAuth client |
| `update_client` | Modify client settings |
| `delete_client` | Remove OAuth client |
| `generate_token` | Generate access tokens |
| `update_settings` | Modify IdP settings |
| `save_config` | Persist configuration changes |

### Admin Secret Protection

When [`management_secret`](#management-secret) is configured, mutating
operations require the secret via the `admin_secret` tool argument.
`NANOIDP_MCP_ADMIN_SECRET` still works too - it's this setting's original,
MCP-only name, kept as an alias:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nanoidp": {
      "command": "nanoidp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "NANOIDP_CONFIG_DIR": "./config",
        "NANOIDP_MCP_ADMIN_SECRET": "your-secret-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Mutating tool calls without the correct secret will be rejected.

### Readonly Mode

To completely disable mutating tools:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
nanoidp-mcp --readonly

# Via environment variable
NANOIDP_MCP_READONLY=true nanoidp-mcp
```

In Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nanoidp": {
      "command": "nanoidp-mcp",
      "args": ["--readonly"],
      "env": {
        "NANOIDP_CONFIG_DIR": "./config"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use readonly mode when you only need introspection (listing users, decoding tokens, viewing settings) but want to prevent accidental modifications.

### Audit Logging

All MCP tool calls are logged to the audit log, including:
- Tool name
- Parameters (secrets redacted)
- Timestamp
- Result status

---

## Multi-hostname Issuer (`issuer_from_request`)

`oauth.issuer_from_request` (off by default) reflects each request's own
Host header as the discovery `issuer`, token `iss`, and device flow
`verification_uri`, so the same NanoIDP can be reached under more than one
hostname (e.g. a Docker Compose service name vs. `localhost`) without a
discovery/token issuer mismatch.

**Trust caveats:**
- The Host header is trusted as-is unless `oauth.issuer_allowlist` is set to
  a non-empty list of allowed origins; a non-matching Host then falls back to
  the fixed `issuer` instead. Only enable `issuer_from_request` without an
  allowlist on trusted networks.
- Behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy, also enable
  `oauth.issuer_from_proxy_headers` so `request.scheme`/`host_url` reflect
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-Host` instead of the proxy's own HTTP
  connection - this only changes the derived issuer when `issuer_from_request`
  is also on (it always affects rate-limit client IP attribution regardless).
  Only enable this when NanoIDP sits directly behind exactly one trusted proxy
  - these headers are otherwise spoofable by any client.
- By default, the device flow's `verification_uri` reflects whichever Host
  called `/device_authorization`. If that caller is a backend/container
  (e.g. `Host: nanoidp:9900`) rather than the end user's own browser, the
  returned URL may not be reachable from the user's machine. Set
  `oauth.device_verification_base_url` to a fixed, human-reachable URL (e.g.
  `https://idp.example.com`) to pin `verification_uri` regardless of the
  calling Host; discovery's `issuer` and a token's `iss` are unaffected and
  keep following the request that fetched/requested them.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NANOIDP_CONFIG_DIR` | Configuration directory path | `./config` |
| `NANOIDP_MANAGEMENT_SECRET` | [Secret](#management-secret) required for mutations across MCP, `/api/*`, and the web UI | (none) |
| `NANOIDP_MCP_ADMIN_SECRET` | Legacy alias for `NANOIDP_MANAGEMENT_SECRET` (MCP-only name, still honored) | (none) |
| `NANOIDP_MCP_READONLY` | Disable mutating MCP tools when set to `true` | `false` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8000` |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use stricter-dev profile** when sharing the instance with team members
2. **Enable readonly mode** for MCP when only introspection is needed
3. **Set `management_secret`** if multiple developers share the same NanoIDP instance - it gates mutating calls on MCP, `/api/*`, and the web UI alike
4. **Rotate keys periodically** to test token validation with multiple keys
5. **Keep the default `127.0.0.1` binding** unless you specifically need network access; only override it on a trusted, isolated network (see [Network Binding](#network-binding))
6. **Never expose NanoIDP to public networks**: it's designed for local/isolated use only
